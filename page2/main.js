I went into the office area to try and find this back terrace I saw while walking around the building. I found myself in the gym where they had one of those Walmart brand peloton bikes. I decidedâ€¦ why not give it a go! Even though everyone was looking at me in the gym like I wasnâ€™t supposed to be there, I went for a stationary two mile bike ride while listening to my book. Happily got off after my ride, cleaned the machine, and went on my way to continue my adventure.\n\nIt seems to me that the quality of mind youâ€™re carrying about with you will help a ton. Itâ€™s much better to slip back into that childlike curiosity than dwell on your adult life where circumstances are only moderately malleable. Slipping into that curiosity is what really makes all of these stories about peopleâ€™s disconnection so salient. Whether itâ€™s reading, day dreaming, gaming, etc. everyone is portraying a level of childlike curiosity about their lives and minds have to offer. Itâ€™s not so serious, enjoy this life and the people around you will enjoy theirs more too.",

We can choose what year we want to fly, and with a week or two of work on installing schedules, we can fly in that year in our flight sim. Currently my project has been 1998, and this has been so incredibly rewarding!\n\nI live by and love my flight sim.
